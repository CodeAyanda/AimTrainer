# AimTrainer

Aim Trainer is a application that can be used by gamers to increase their reflex speeds. 
You have 30 seconds to click on the randomly appearing target on the screen. Clicking outside the target decreases your accuracy.
The app also has a leaderboard where top scores and player names are stored.

Play Game : Download 'Run' folder. Open SpeedTyper.exe (was initially creating a speed typing measuring application but that might be a future project)

Source Code : Download 'Code' folder / GameCodeAsText.txt

Game Notes: Experimented with moving pictureBoxes to different locations on the screen. The leaderboard stores scores in a text file. Accuracy is calculated using 100 - (total clicks/score)*100
